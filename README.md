### Hi, I'm João Victor Coutinho 🤙🏽
I was born and currently live in Pernambuco - Brazil. I'm working at [Raid Hut](https://raidhut.com/) as Software Engineer.

🔭 I’m currently working on full-stack and operation **game development**, using extensively these skills there:
- Unity 
- C# (tools)
- Python (backend)

Previously, I was using these skills:
- React JS
- React Native/Expo
- PHP
- C# (hard-work scripting)

🌱 My current goal is to learn more about these areas in order to reach proficiency. Then, I'm currently learning or improving:
- Data/event-oriented programming
- Entity Component System architecture
- Test-Driven Development
- Golang language

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **game engines**, **game projects** or anything sufficiently interesting, writing clean code and proposing solutions.
